# SecurePass Android App
SecurePass is an Android application that securely stores user credentials and generates random, secure passwords. It provides a convenient and encrypted way for users to manage their passwords and access them whenever needed.

### Features
* Credential Storage: Safely store and manage user credentials, including usernames, passwords, and associated application/website names.
* Password Generator: Generate strong, random passwords with customizable length and complexity requirements.
* Encryption: Encrypt user data using robust encryption algorithms to ensure the security and confidentiality of stored credentials.
* Biometric Authentication: Enable biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) to securely access stored credentials.
* Auto-fill Integration: Seamlessly integrate with the Android system's auto-fill feature to conveniently fill in login information on supported applications and websites.
* Password Strength Assessment: Evaluate the strength of user-generated passwords to encourage the use of strong and secure credentials.
* Backup and Sync: Enable backup and synchronization of encrypted credential data across multiple devices for easy access and recovery.
